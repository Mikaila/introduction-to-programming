      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Our introduction to programming class will get you familiar with all the basics and principles, using Ruby as the primary learning language. Weâ€™ll spend plenty of time covering all the software tips and tricks you need as well. The current class begins on Monday, April 25 and continues each Monday at 7 PM until June 13.</p>

      <p>For more details and registration, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopitcbus/events/17233792/">visit the Meetup page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Materials</h3>

      <p>We will be using the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Pragmatic-Programmers-Chris/dp/0976694042">Learn to Program</a> by Chris Pine.  The book will be provided in the first class.</p>

      <h3>Pre-work</h3>

      <p>Before coming to class, we would like everyone to try and setup their laptops with everything you will need to write code. It's ok if you get stuck, we will be there to help on the first night and you're welcome to come a bit early for this if you'd like.  No worries.</p>

        <p>Install Ruby</p>
        
        <p class="stepDescription">The easiest way to install Ruby is to go ahead and install the <a href="http://www.railsinstaller.org">RailsInstaller</a>. Click on the big green button and you are off and running. This will install Ruby as well as a few other tools that you will find useful in using Ruby moving forward (especially if you are interested in seeing how to develop web applications). This will also install Git, a version control system, we will be using extensively with <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> (don't worry, we will explain all of this and why it is important as we go along). </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ruby: The Programming Language we will be using</li>
			<li>Git: The version control system we will be using</li>
			<li>Rails: The tools to build web applications with Ruby</li>
			<li>Sqlite: A simple and lightweight database</li>
			<li>DevKit: General tools that Ruby needs to build libraries for you</li>
		</ul>
        <p>Install a Text Editor</p>
        
        <p class="stepDescription">When programming, you will need something to enter your code into. A text editor is usually best. This is an application that lets you enter text, but does not do ANY formatting of any kind (like word would do). Many editors have features that make your programming life a little easier (like highlighting certain words, or letting you create buttons that run certain bits of code). </p>
		<p class="stepDescription">One common editor you could install would be <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad ++</a>. It's free and easy to install. Just use the installer link from the Downloads page (or click <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/5.9/npp.5.9.Installer.exe">here</a>) and follow the instructions.</p>
		<p class="stepDescription">Another common editor that will do the trick, and is also free, is <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</a>. It's a fun little editor that has some great configuration options (including changing your color scheme). You can download it here. You can download the latest build <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/download/cedt360r.exe">here</a>.</p>

        <a name="mac"><h4>Mac Setup</h4></a>
      
        <p>Install Ruby</p>
        
        <p class="stepDescription">Good news!  Macs come pre-installed with ruby.  You will, however, need git and a good text editor.</p>
      
        <p>Install Git</p>

		<p class="stepDescription">You will need to install Git, a version control system, we will be using extensively with <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> (don't worry, we will explain all of this and why it is important as we go along). In order to install git, simply <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/detail?name=git-1.7.4.4-i386-leopard.dmg&can=3&q=">go here</a> and start the download for git. Install the .pkg file for git.</p>
		<p class="stepDescription">Next, follow <a href="http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/">these instructions</a> on setting up your ssh keys. These are the keys that allow you to work with github. Again, just follow the instructions, and do not worry, we will explain everything in class.</a>
        
        <p class="stepDescription"></p>
        
        <p>Install a Text Editor</p>

		<p class="stepDescription">When programming, you will need something to enter your code into. A text editor is usually best. This is an application that lets you enter text, but does not do ANY formatting of any kind (like word would do). Many editors have features that make your programming life a little easier (like highlighting certain words, or letting you create buttons that run certain bits of code). </p>
		<p class="stepDescription">The best text editor for the mac is unfortunately one that costs money. It's <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate by Macromates</a>. It does come with a 30 day trial and we HIGHLY recommend at least trying it out. You might be surprised and want to pay for it when this is all said and done. If you do download it, also download <a href="http://alternateidea.com/blog/files/tm-vibrantink-theme-prototype-bundle.zip">this theme for it</a>. After you have installed TextMate, simply unzip this file and double click the Vibrant Ink theme. It will install it for you automagically.</a> 
		<p class="stepDescription">In terms of free editors you have a few to choose from. One popular one is <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a>. It is a text editor that provides code highlighting. Another would be <a href=" http://redcareditor.com/">RedCar</a>. This one is really good, but still in alpha so it could be a little rough. You use ruby to install it and can find the instructions <a href="https://github.com/redcar/redcar/wiki/installation">here</a></p>
